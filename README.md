# Airline Profit Prediction using Random Forest

## Introduction

In the airline industry, profitability is determined by a variety of factors, including flight delays, operating costs, fuel efficiency, and more. This project aims to predict **profit (USD)** for each flight based on various operational and financial features using **Machine Learning** techniques. The primary goal is to leverage **Random Forest Regressor** to understand how different features impact the profit and identify the most influential factors.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the **profit (USD)** for each flight. The model uses various features such as **Revenue (USD)**, **Operating Cost (USD)**, **Revenue per ASK**, and **Cost per ASK**. The model will be trained using historical flight data and will help airline operators optimize operations and enhance profitability.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of several operational and financial features for each flight:

- **Flight Number**: Unique identifier for each flight.
- **Scheduled Departure Time**: The planned departure time for the flight.
- **Actual Departure Time**: The actual time the flight departs.
- **Delay (Minutes)**: The difference between the scheduled and actual departure time, measured in minutes.
- **Aircraft Utilization (Hours/Day)**: The average number of hours per day the aircraft is utilized.
- **Turnaround Time (Minutes)**: Time taken for a plane to prepare for its next flight.
- **Load Factor (%)**: Percentage of available seats filled on the flight.
- **Fleet Availability (%)**: Percentage of the fleet that is operational.
- **Maintenance Downtime (Hours)**: Time spent on maintenance per aircraft.
- **Fuel Efficiency (ASK)**: Fuel consumption efficiency.
- **Revenue (USD)**: Total revenue generated by the flight.
- **Operating Cost (USD)**: Total cost incurred to operate the flight.
- **Net Profit Margin (%)**: Profit margin percentage.
- **Ancillary Revenue (USD)**: Additional income generated beyond ticket sales.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Financial ratio indicating the balance between debt and equity.
- **Revenue per ASK**: Revenue generated per available seat kilometer.
- **Cost per ASK**: Cost incurred per available seat kilometer.
- **Profit (USD)**: The target variable, representing the profit from the flight.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to predict the **Profit (USD)** for each flight using the machine learning model. By understanding which features have the most influence on profit, the airline can optimize operations and reduce costs.

## Insights from the Dataset

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection, the key findings from the dataset are:

- **Highly Correlated Features**: The **Revenue (USD)**, **Operating Cost (USD)**, **Revenue per ASK**, and **Cost per ASK** are the most highly correlated features with each other. These features contribute most to predicting profit, which makes sense given that operating revenue and cost directly determine profitability.
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: The Random Forest model, when used for feature selection, highlighted the same four features as having the highest importance, reaffirming their significance in predicting profit.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Removed any irrelevant columns and handled missing data.
   
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized the relationships between different features using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**.
   - Analyzed correlations among features
   
### 3. Feature Selection
   - Used **Random Forest Regressor** for feature selection based on feature importance scores.
   - Focused on the four most important features identified by both the correlation matrix and Random Forest: **Revenue (USD)**, **Operating Cost (USD)**, **Revenue per ASK**, and **Cost per ASK**.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
   - Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict **Profit (USD)**.
   - Applied **cross-validation** to assess the performance of the model.
   - Evaluated the model using various metrics:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **R-squared (R²)**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

### 5. Conclusion
   The Random Forest Regressor model effectively predicts **Profit (USD)** based on the selected features. The four most important features—**Revenue (USD)**, **Operating Cost (USD)**, **Revenue per ASK**, and **Cost per ASK**—are the main contributors to the target variable. This finding underscores the importance of managing both revenue and costs in maximizing profitability.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Python**: Used for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization and generating plots.
- **RandomForestRegressor**: For feature selection and model training.
- **Cross-Validation**: For model evaluation and ensuring robustness.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the machine learning algorithm and evaluation metrics.

## Model Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the model's predictions.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Provides the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis and feature selection, it can be concluded that **Revenue (USD)**, **Operating Cost (USD)**, **Revenue per ASK**, and **Cost per ASK** are the key factors influencing profit. By optimizing these features, airlines can maximize profitability and improve operational efficiency.
